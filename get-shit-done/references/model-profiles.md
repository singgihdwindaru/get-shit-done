# Model Profiles

Model profiles control which model each GSD agent uses. This allows balancing quality vs token spend, or inheriting the currently selected session model.

## Profile Definitions

| Agent | `quality` | `balanced` | `budget` | `inherit` |
|-------|-----------|------------|----------|-----------|
| gsd-planner | opus | opus | sonnet | inherit |
| gsd-roadmapper | opus | sonnet | sonnet | inherit |
| gsd-executor | opus | sonnet | sonnet | inherit |
| gsd-phase-researcher | opus | sonnet | haiku | inherit |
| gsd-project-researcher | opus | sonnet | haiku | inherit |
| gsd-research-synthesizer | sonnet | sonnet | haiku | inherit |
| gsd-debugger | opus | sonnet | sonnet | inherit |
| gsd-codebase-mapper | sonnet | haiku | haiku | inherit |
| gsd-verifier | sonnet | sonnet | haiku | inherit |
| gsd-plan-checker | sonnet | sonnet | haiku | inherit |
| gsd-integration-checker | sonnet | sonnet | haiku | inherit |
| gsd-nyquist-auditor | sonnet | sonnet | haiku | inherit |

## Profile Philosophy

**quality** - Maximum reasoning power
- Opus for all decision-making agents
- Sonnet for read-only verification
- Use when: quota available, critical architecture work

**balanced** (default) - Smart allocation
- Opus only for planning (where architecture decisions happen)
- Sonnet for execution and research (follows explicit instructions)
- Sonnet for verification (needs reasoning, not just pattern matching)
- Use when: normal development, good balance of quality and cost

**budget** - Minimal Opus usage
- Sonnet for anything that writes code
- Haiku for research and verification
- Use when: conserving quota, high-volume work, less critical phases

**inherit** - Follow the current session model
- All agents resolve to `inherit`
- Best when you switch models interactively
- Use when: you want GSD to follow your currently selected model

## Using with Custom Models

The GSD installer sets `resolve_model_ids: "omit"` in `~/.gsd/defaults.json` by default for Copilot. This returns an empty model parameter for all agents, so each agent uses the runtime's default model. No manual setup is needed.

To assign different models to different agents, add `model_overrides` with model IDs your runtime recognizes:

```json
{
  "resolve_model_ids": "omit",
  "model_overrides": {
    "gsd-planner": "o3",
    "gsd-executor": "o4-mini",
    "gsd-debugger": "o3",
    "gsd-codebase-mapper": "o4-mini"
  }
}
```

The same tiering logic applies: stronger models for planning and debugging, cheaper models for execution and mapping.

## Resolution Logic

Orchestrators resolve model before spawning:

```
1. Read .planning/config.json
2. Check model_overrides for agent-specific override
3. If no override, look up agent in profile table
4. Pass model parameter to Task call
```

## Per-Agent Overrides

Override specific agents without changing the entire profile:

```json
{
  "model_profile": "balanced",
  "model_overrides": {
    "gsd-executor": "opus",
    "gsd-planner": "haiku"
  }
}
```

Overrides take precedence over the profile. Valid values: `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`, `inherit`, or any fully-qualified model ID.

## Switching Profiles

Runtime: `/gsd-set-profile <profile>`

Per-project default: Set in `.planning/config.json`:
```json
{
  "model_profile": "balanced"
}
```

## Design Rationale

**Why Opus for gsd-planner?**
Planning involves architecture decisions, goal decomposition, and task design. This is where model quality has the highest impact.

**Why Sonnet for gsd-executor?**
Executors follow explicit PLAN.md instructions. The plan already contains the reasoning; execution is implementation.

**Why Sonnet (not Haiku) for verifiers in balanced?**
Verification requires goal-backward reasoning - checking if code *delivers* what the phase promised, not just pattern matching. Sonnet handles this well; Haiku may miss subtle gaps.

**Why Haiku for gsd-codebase-mapper?**
Read-only exploration and pattern extraction. No reasoning required, just structured output from file contents.

**Why `inherit` profile?**
The `inherit` profile keeps all GSD subagents aligned to your currently selected model, avoiding version conflicts and unexpected costs from model-specific API calls.
